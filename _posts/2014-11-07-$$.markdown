Returns an array of elements that match the given CSS selector. This command is
equivalent to calling [`document.querySelectorAll()`](https://docs.webplatform.o
rg/wiki/css/selectors_api/querySelectorAll).[^1]

### Exercises

{% include examples/shapes_example.html %}

Using `$$`:

* select the elements with class `shape`. how many are there?
* select the elements with class `parallelogram`. how many are there?
* there is only one element with class `circle`. if you use `$$` to select it,
  do you still receive an array in return? try using a single `$`.
